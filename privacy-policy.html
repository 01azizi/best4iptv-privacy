    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <div class="notice">
        <strong>Data handling:</strong> We do not transmit your IPTV server credentials (URLs, usernames, passwords), favorites, or viewing history to our servers; these remain on your device. However, the app communicates with certain third‑party services to provide features, including Google AdMob (ads), Google User Messaging Platform (consent), Google Cast (optional), and an IP‑based geolocation service to display approximate weather when location permission is not granted.
    </div>

    <h3>Purposes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> To provide IPTV playback and recording features</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> To remember your preferences and settings</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> To improve app performance (all analytics are local)</li>
